##The following two queries were used to determine Rockbuster's top 10 customers in terms of revenue.

select D.country, c.city_id,
c.city, sum(e.amount) AS revenue
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID 
INNER JOIN payment E ON e.customer_id = a.customer_id
WHERE country in ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil', 'Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia') 
GROUP BY country, city, c.city_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 11;

# Note: LIMIT 11 was used as there are two US cities named Aurora, both with the same city_id. As their individual revenue is less than the other cities given, the following query was then run.

select D.country,
c.city, sum(e.amount) AS revenue
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID 
INNER JOIN payment E ON e.customer_id = a.customer_id
WHERE country in ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil', 'Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia') 
AND city IN ('Cape Coral','Santa Brbara dOeste','Memphis','Tanza', 'Valparai','Santa Rosa','Tanauan','Halisahar','Bijapur','Usolje-Sibirskoje') 
GROUP BY country, city
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
