# Data_Analysis_SQL
This is a presentation of a project from the CareerFoundry data analysis training demonstrating postGreSQL to extract insights.

The objective of this project was to load all of a fictional video rental company's data into a relational database management system and then use SQL to analyze the data and answer various business questions. The key questions were:

-Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

-What was the average rental duration for all videos?

-Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

-Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

-Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

The deliverables include a presentation that answers these questions, an Excel file meant for technical colleagues demonstrating the SQL queries and their results, and a data dictionary. The graphs and charts used in the presentation were generated by Tableau.
